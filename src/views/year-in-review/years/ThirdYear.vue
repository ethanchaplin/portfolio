                If I'm going to be completely honest, the first part of my third year played
                out like a filler episode of a TV show. I was still working at Genetesis, but this time
                I was doing it remotely from my home in Tallmadge, about 3 hours away. This was advantageous,
                as I was able to save on gas and rent, but it was also a bit of a drag, as I was missing out on
                the social aspect of working in an office. I was able to find some opportunities to head back to
                Cincinnati
                every once in a while, which broke up the monotony a bit.

                The pace picked up a little as I headed back down for my fall semester. Heading into August I already
                had an offer from
                Goodyear for an internship in the spring, so I knew my time was limited in Cincy. This acted as a great
                motivator for me to
                get out and try an assortment of new things. I took an Honors Pinball course, which might've been my
                favorite course of the entire
                semester, and the rest of my classes were becoming more major specific. Throughout all that, I also
                signed up for a Hackathon with a couple of
                my friends, and that was an interesting experience for sure. Trying to code on no sleep is not something
                I'd recommend, but it was still a great experience.

                I headed back to Akron in the spring to start my co-op at Goodyear. The first two weeks were extremely
                slow,
                and I soon found out what the term "corporate" really meant. Everything was locked down, and I had to
                get permission
                to access the slightest thing, which cramped my productivity for a bit. Things picked up the pace around
                early Feburary,
                right in time for my side projects to start taking off as well. I was also working with Jady for their
                headlining show
                in Feburary at Newport Music Hall, which was the biggest show they had ever played. It sold 1200
                tickets, and the experience
                of planning and running lights for a packed concert like that was unlike anything else I had ever
                experienced. I really picked
                up more involvement in Akron, and joined a volleyball club, a pickleball club, and had a lot of time to
                hang out with my old
                friends from home. My last day at Goodyear was on my birthday, and once again I recieved an email from
                Taco Bell that my scholarship
                had renewed!
