    <h1>Freshman Year</h1>
    <h2>/** getting the hang of things **/</h2>
    <p>
      As a freshman going into your first year of college, you are most likely
      filled to the brim of tips and advice about navigating life on campus, in
      classes, and everywhere else you go. I know this was me in the summer
      months of 2021 as I prepared to start my first semester at the University
      of Cincinnati. It was hard for me to take all the encouragement to heart,
      as I had yet to experience spending more than a week at a time away from
      my hometown. My previous life as a person growing up in Tallmadge was
      ingrained into the fiber of my being and imagining another life outside of
      it seemed unlikely. To aid the transition of being away from home so much,
      I worked as an overnight summer camp from May to August and this meant
      that I was away from home for 75% of the time, but weekends were still an
      opportunity to come and recharge with my family.

      The first weekend on campus was one of the hardest for me, because it
      solidified the notion that physically I was now on my own. Obviously, my
      parents would be one call away to discuss anything that needed discussed,
      but a 250-mile divided by a 4 hour drive up I-71 meant that if I wasn’t
      actively dying, I would be the one leading the charge when it came to
      problems or general decision making. This had been something I dreamed
      about for years, but the realization of it all struck very sharply that
      first weekend, where I had been previously conditioned that Saturdays were
      for coming home to my parents.

      Like a new sailor on the seas, it took a bit of time for me to gain my
      “campus legs”. Learning what routines and activities fit my schedule on a
      weekly-to-monthly basis as well as balancing social and academic circles
      did not come necessarily easy, and it took some trial and error to find
      what worked for me and what didn’t. There were times when the homesickness
      would strike, and the fear of having made the wrong choice about college
      was all too common, but I planted my feet and told myself that this was
      the place I was supposed to be. By keeping my head level, I was able to
      navigate doubts and concerns and fears surrounding my life as a new
      college student and continued to perform well in academic and social
      contexts. Over the course of my first two semesters, I grew in a practical
      nature, such as learning to stay on top of my laundry in a (relatively)
      consistent schedule, and in more conceptual natures, such as learning how
      to balance your work-life-friend schedule without burning yourself out.

      I remember the anxiety I felt on move-in day, with a crowd of 40,000 new
      faces I had never seen before. Since none of my close friends from home
      had chosen to come to Cincinnati as well, so I was essentially on my own.
      However, leaving campus for the final time on that brisk Friday morning in
      April I realized how much I had grown into the school and my new life, and
      how that no matter how many first days I would experience again on that
      campus I would never again feel that fear of isolation. With my parents
      still by my side through it all (even if not physically), and with the
      community of friends that I had formed around me at school, I know that
      I’m never truly alone.
