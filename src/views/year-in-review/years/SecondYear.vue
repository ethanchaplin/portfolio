      <h1>Sophomore Year</h1>

      <p>
        If I said that my second year at the University of Cincinnati was
        decently busy, I would be selling it <b>way</b> short. This was the year
        that a lot of the seeds I had planted my freshman took sprout, and boy
        was there a lot to harvest.
      </p>

      <p>
        To start, I was blessed with the opportunity to co-op at Genetesis, a
        medical imaging firm located in Mason, OH. It was here that I got to
        experience working in a professional software position for the first
        time. I had no idea what to expect going into it, but it was a wonderful
        experience through and through. My co-workers were some of the nicest
        people I've had the pleasure of working with, and they made it a joy to
        come into the office every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I say that
        because they let me take a hybrid schedule, which meant that I worked
        from home on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which was suprisingly an amazing
        format. This format not only allowed me to save on gas, but it was a way
        to break up the monotony of working at a desk everyday. Often I would
        park myself at a local coffee shop until noon, and then head back to my
        apartment to finish the day. I learned a lot about software development,
        especially in a collaborative context, and this experience was invaluble
        beyond measure.

        Having only responsibilities from 9-5 meant my free time got a whole lot
        more free, and that meant I could invest in my relationships in
        Cincinnati, as well as pursue some passion projects which I didn't
        really have the time for in the past. I began working with my friends
        Jarrett and Ashton of the band "Jady" to run lights for their
        performances, as they were starting to sell out venues in Columbus. This
        even led to me joining them for a show in Nashville (which also sold
        out, by the way), which was a blast.
      </p>

        Heading into the spring semester, I had the delight of returning to
        classes (you can hear the sarcasm, right?), and gone was the general
        element of temporal freedom. It took a little getting used to the
        complete 180 in routine, as my classes were sporadic, and this was a
        shift from the 9-5 I was used to. However, not all was lost, as I loved
        the classes I was taking. From low-level assembly in Intro to Computer
        Systems to balanced binary trees in Data Structures, I was starting to
        get a whiff of pure computer science, and I was stoked. I hope to be
        more than just a web developer one day, and these classes showed me just
        how deep the rabbit hole goes.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also had the opportunity to be a TA for the ENED 1120 course. For
        those unfamiliar, ENED is the required first year course that all
        engineers have to take. It's a tougher class, and is often the source of
        ire for a lot of freshmen. I was only a year removed from the course, so
        I fully understood what the students were going through and what it took
        to keep up with the course. I had a wonderful time assisting Dr. Yoona
        with her section, and I (hopefully) made some sort of impact of the
        students in my class. I also had the privilege of making this a
        pre-approved Honors experience, so all in all it was a worthwhile
        experience.

        Inspired by my at-the-time girlfriend, I decided to apply for the
        $10,000 Taco Bell Live Más scholarship in early January. The application
        form stated that awards would not be handed out until April 25, so that
        date took residence in the back of my mind for the entire semester. In
        all honesty, I didn't think I was going to get it, but shots in the dark
        are what college is all about, so why not? It didn't cost me anything.
        April 25 came, and I must've refreshed my email at least 100 times, but
        I got no word from the Taco Bell Foundation. I wasn't devastated, but it
        had been a cool hypothetical to think about what would happen if I did
        win it. I woke up on my birthday, April 26, to an email from the Taco
        Bell Foundation:
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3><b>Congrats! You are a Live Más Scholarship recipient! </b></h3>
      </p>

      <p>It's cool or whatever.</p>
